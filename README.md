# Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of Sports Bookmakers

## Summary during Conducting the Project

*Apr-2008 to Apr-2010*
**Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of Sports-Bookmakers**

- Learn RExcel, CrystalBall, ModelRisk etc. and choose R open source software to start my research.
- Collect the livescore and also 1x2, Asian Handicap, Over Under odds price data of 29 sportsbookmakers manually from 500WAN, BET007 and NowGoal website and filter the odds price data from 2006 to 2011.
- Apply Poisson model in R to test the return of the investment. This research job is the most completed, success and the first research which write the whole odds compilation EM model and data management by refer to thousands of research papers in sportsbook odds modelling after resigned from Caspo Inc.

## Abstract

  In this paper I am applied a diagonal inflated biviriate poisson as well as a simple staking model whereby evaluate the efficiency of odds price of Asian Handicap and Goal Line offered by 40 sports bookmakers. Finally I get a breakdown profit & lose table. While I used **Kelly model**^[Refer to [Testing Inefficiency of Sports-Bookmakers by Kelly Model](https://github.com/Scibrokes/Kelly-Criterion)] next to this research which generated profit (positive return of investment) more than 30% every year.
