\Abstract{
In this paper I am applied a diagonal inflated biviriate poisson as well
as a simple staking model whereby evaluate the efficiency of odds price
of Asian Handicap and Goal Line offered by 40 sports bookmakers. Finally
I get a breakdown profit \& lose table. While I used Kelly model next to
this research which generated a profit every year.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The odds modelling in Europe and United States are very popular since
decades. However statistical odds modelling and algorithmic staking has
not yet popular in Far East Asia. \bigbreak

By refer to \emph{Dixon \& Coles 1996}\footnote{Refer to reference paper
  02}, \emph{Karlis \& Ntzoufras 2005}\footnote{Refer to reference paper
  08} and also \emph{Dixon \& Pope 2004}\footnote{Refer to reference
  paper 05} I tried to collect soccer data from year 2006 to 2011. The
purpose of the research is testing the inefficiency of soccer odds
offered by 29 bookmakers as well as making profit from bookmakers.
\bigbreak

The paper \emph{Dixon \& Coles 1996} inspired by the \emph{Maher
1982}\footnote{Refer to reference paper 01} to identify the offence and
defence index of every single team where \emph{Karlis \& Ntzoufras 2005}
enahanced to be more complicated model. \emph{Moya 2012}\footnote{Refer
  to reference paper 10} taken 40000 customers' data from bwin to
analayse and profit and lose and applied diversified staking strategies
to make profit from bookmakers. \emph{Goddard 2004}\footnote{Refer to
  reference paper 09} model an ordered probit regression and placed
stkes on English soccer leagues from 1998 to 2002 and finally yeild
\texttt{1998/99} = 0.116, \texttt{1999/00} = 0.008, \texttt{2000/01} =
-0.008, \texttt{2001/02} = 0.160. \bigbreak

Well, \emph{Dixon \& Robinson 1997}\footnote{Refer to reference paper 03}
has built a rebirth model on 90 minutes In-Play soccer gaming.
\emph{Crowder, Dixon, Anthony \& Robinson 2001}\footnote{Refer to
  reference paper 04} applied MCMC\footnote{Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  model} model for soccer result prediction and do a comparison with
previous \emph{Dixon \& Coles 1996} model where concludes that previous
model forecast more precisely. \bigbreak

Similar with \emph{Dixon \& Coles 1996}, \emph{Karlis \& Ntzuofras
1998}\footnote{Refer to reference paper 06} has encountered an issue
which is a number of nil-nil tied games. while \emph{Dixon \& Coles
1996} applied an inflation on low scores games while \emph{Karlis \&
Ntzoufras 2005} built an extra distribution parameter to settle it.
\bigbreak

The latest research paper wrote by Dixon is that \emph{Dixon \& Pope
2004} which have reviewed the previous model and testing the efficiency
on correct score of 3 major firms in UK. \emph{Karlis \& Ntzuofras 2007}
make a summary of evolution on his research which is apply Skellam's
distribution on bivariate poisson model to resolve the obstacle of draw
games. \bigbreak

Section 2 discribe a statiscal model applicable to soccer odds
modelling. Section 3 talk about the dataset while section 4 model focus
on staking model. Section 5 present the result and last section
conclude.

\section{Modelling}\label{modelling}

\subsection{Basic Model}\label{basic-model}

As mentioned in \emph{Karlis \& Ntzuofras 2005}, bivariate Poisson
models are appropriate for modeling paired count data exhibiting
correlation. Paired count data arise in a wide context including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  marketing (number of purchases of different products)
\item
  epidemiology (incidents of different diseases in a series of
  districts)
\item
  accident analysis (number of accidents in a site before and after
  infrastructure changes)
\item
  medical research (the number of seizures before and after treatment)
\item
  sports (the number of goals scored by each one of the two opponent
  teams in soccer)
\item
  econometrics (number of voluntary and involuntary job changes)
\end{itemize}

Where I just to name a few among the use. \bigbreak

\textbf{Bivariate Poisson regression models} \bigbreak

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers/blob/master/figure/1-bp.png?raw=true}
\caption{Bivariate Poisson regression models}
\end{figure}

From above formula, bivariate poisson basically measure the
correlationship between \emph{X} and \emph{Y} compare to double poisson
models. However, as I mentioned which is \emph{Dixon \& Coles 1996}
modified a little on the score 0-0, 1-0, 1-1 and vice versa. \bigbreak

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers/blob/master/figure/2-cov.png?raw=true}
\caption{Double Poisson regression models}
\end{figure}

A Double poisson model can be easily applied by generalized linear
model. The covariates is a constant parameter across all soccer matches
or teams as we know from figure 2. \bigbreak

\textbf{Diagonal Inflated Bivariate Poisson regression models} \bigbreak

Due to the bivariate is not accurate enough and applicable to predict
the real life soccer result. \emph{Karlis \& Ntzuofras 2005} introduced
a more complicated model which able to inflated the probabilities of the
occurrance on draw games. \bigbreak

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers/blob/master/figure/3-dbp.png?raw=true}
\caption{Diagonal Inflated Bivariate Poisson regression models}
\end{figure}

The author then introduced Skellam's distribution which measure the
correlation between \emph{X} and \emph{Y} on draw games, he term it as
Zero-Inflated Poisson Model. \bigbreak

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers/blob/master/figure/4-sd.png?raw=true}
\caption{Skellam's Distribution for Football Scores}
\end{figure}

Well, when we talk about the parameter to measure the correlationship.
How can we know what models might fit into it? \emph{Karlis \& Ntzuofras
2005} has compare few models which are :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Discrete distribution (with an adjustable paramters)
\item
  Poisson distribution
\item
  Geometric distribution
\end{itemize}

They built 12 statistical models to compare and get the best fit model.
For more details kindly refer to the paper.

\hypertarget{model-enhancement}{\subsection{Model
Enhancement}\label{model-enhancement}}

There has a popular quote in sportsbook betting industry which is term
as \texttt{FORM}. There is a flutuation of the ability and aggresiveness
on sports competition as time goes by. Lets review the \emph{Dixon \&
Coles 1996} model and fit the decay parameter into our basic model.
\bigbreak

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics{https://github.com/scibrokes/odds-modelling-and-testing-inefficiency-of-sports-bookmakers/blob/master/figure/5-df.png?raw=true}
\caption{decay rates}
\end{figure}

After simulation, I get a decay rate which is almost \texttt{0.0065} and
similar with \emph{Dixon \& Coles 1996}. However, due to I consider the
soccer matches has come out result once the whistle is blew. Therefore
I've tried to build another model which is similar with Weibull model to
make the decay rate flexible compare to constantly annum. few models,
which are: \bigbreak

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Count in the soccer result once a soccer match is finished to get a
  dynamic decay rates to refresh next prediction odds price.
\item
  Follow \emph{Dixon \& Coles 1996} which taken a constant decay rates
  for a soccer session.
\item
  Count in the soccer result once a week to get a weekly dynamic decay
  rates to predict next week soccer matches.
\end{itemize}

I got a vector of decay rates around \texttt{0.0045} with the standard
deviation not more than 1\textasciitilde{}10\%. which is similar with
the model at \href{http://matchodds.org}{MatchOdds.org}.

  more than 10 hours per day and around half year time manually copy and
  paste the odds price (soccer matches data, all events in all English 9
  leagues + cups as well as all Japanese leagues and tournaments for
  both prematch as well as the rebirth modelling, and also testing
  staking model's purpose)} to gather data from below websites. You are

\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  there are 4389 soccer matches used as sample in our research.
\item
  unfortunately, odds prices of around 10 to 20 soccer matches inside
  research works have no data source.
\item
  open prices and closed prices collected but only open prices get into
  research works.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Convertion to Odds Price}\label{convertion-to-odds-price}

\textbf{Odds Price based on Pure Probabilities} \bigbreak

\caption{odds price with vigorish}
\end{figure}

From above description we know the bookmakers has charges a certain
spread margin / overounds / vigorish. \bigbreak

\textbf{Odds Price based with Vigorish} \bigbreak

Therefore we need to convert to a net probabilities without vigorish to
compare with our time series diagonal inflation bivariate poisson
regression model. \bigbreak

\textbf{Remarks} : you are feel free to browse over
\href{https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research\%20Project\%202}{dataset} of
\textbf{Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of Sports-Bookmakers}
\emph{2008-2010 by ®yo Eng Lian Hu} to observe the EM odds, odds price
offered by bookmakers without vigorish as well as with vigorish for
every single soccer match. Total soccer matches in this research project
has 4389 across 8 leagues + tournaments in England.

\section{Betting Strategies}\label{betting-strategies}

\subsection{Comparison of Efficiency of the
Models}\label{comparison-of-efficiency-of-the-models}

By refer to \emph{Dixon \& Pope 2004}, before we start build our staking
model, we try to summarize the statistical prices offered by 40 sports
bookmakers on both Asian Handicap and Goal Line. \bigbreak

\subsection{Staking Model}\label{staking-model}

As I mentioned in section \protect\hyperlink{model-enhancement}{Model
Enhancement} on the decay rates. In order to test the efficiency and the
return of investment, I've taken both models in \emph{algorithmic
simulations}\footnote{I tried to fit the constant decay rates, weekly
  dynamical decay rates and dynamical decat rates just right after
  finish a soccer match. It is my previous research saved in
  Rmodel.RData files prior to start this spreadsheet. Therefore this
  spreadsheet only taken the compleleted and converted odds price for
  staking and testing efficiency purpose.}. For the staking model, I
just simply using the most simple staking model which from \emph{Dixon
\& Coles 1996}. \bigbreak

Only \$1 One dollar placed on every level of edge from 1.00 until 4.00.
Kindly refer to below sample table. \bigbreak

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\subsection{Conclusion}\label{conclusion-1}

This spreadsheet test the efficiency of Asian Handicap odds prices of 29
bookmakers with a scientific betting strategy based on a EM model
(Expectation Maximization)\\
Firstly, get the English soccer matches data, then compile odds price
based on EM model, based on that model simply placed bets on only when
``EM model / Bookmaker's Prob \textgreater{} Ratio''. \bigbreak

From the result of this research on 2 Seasons English Soccer Leagues, we
conclude the below points:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  proof that nowadays we are hard to make profit from 29 bookmakers
  based on simple betting strategy (EMProb / BKProb).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    there are no Asian Handicap betting models in academics research
    industry, somemore sophisticated betting model needed.
  \item
    furthermore, some matches have no odds prices may caused the betting
    made a lose result.
  \item
    the most importance point is that bookmakers take a very high
    advantages which is higher than norminal virogish (refer to
    application of Malay odds, and also Ryo handicap.xlsx spreadsheet to
    know the calculation of real vigorish).
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Works}\label{future-works}

I applied \textbf{Kelly model}\footnote{Refer to
  \href{https://github.com/Scibrokes/Kelly-Criterion}{Testing
  Inefficiency of Sports-Bookmakers by Kelly Model}} next to this
research which generated profit (positive return of investment) more
than 30\% every year. \bigbreak

While now I am using dataset from European famous sportsbook consultancy
firm to test thier staking model and efficiency. Wher I need to modify
existing Kelly model to be half, quarter etc to control the risk similar
with \emph{Moya 2012}. \bigbreak

There has a weakness in this paper which is gathered dataset are history
odds price while I am learning to build a real time trading system now.
However a profit return from my few years research and put my all time
and affort in this sportbook research is worthable, happier and
stimulated to be more aggresive to continue my journey to setup own
hedge fund company \textbf{Scibrokes}.

\subsection{Speech and Blooper}\label{speech-and-blooper}

Firstly I do appreciate those who shade me a light on my research.
Meanwhile I do happy and learn from the research. I do appreciated to
take some spared time to write this thesis where the research has start
from 2008 and finish in 2012. Infact I've finished my research on 2010
before I wrote a proposal to acquire the
\href{http://www.ladbrokesplc.com/}{Ladbrokes}\footnote{Ladbrokes is a
  world leader in the betting and gaming industry with over 2,700
  betting outlets in the UK, Ireland, Belgium and Spain and over 800,000
  active online customers. British public listed company which in the
  Fortune 500 and over hundred years business group.} trading and hedge
fund project in Scicom (MSC) Bhd and extended dataset soccer matches
until 2012. Unfortunately the project has closed but I keep up learning
journey to run my own company
\href{https://github.com/scibrokes/owner}{Scibrokes}\footnote{A
  registered company but not yet in operation. A prospective statistical
  hedge fund company.} some other days. I'll started work as customer
service executive but in somewhere else next week, I am currently
studying distance course data science at
\href{http://www.coursera.org}{Coursera.org}. You are feel free to
browse over my CV at
\href{https://beta.rstudioconnect.com/englianhu/ryo-eng/}{®yo Eng Lian
Hu}. \bigbreak

I started my research journey when I decided to resign from Caspo Inc.
to be an customer service operator in Scicom (MSC) Bhd. I've search,
collected and read through thousands of research papers to get the
applicable model in our real life investment. Fortunately I found and
know a person
\href{https://englianhu.wordpress.com/sportsbook/boffins-vs-bookies-the-man-who-broke-the-world-leading-bookmakers/}{Boffins
-vs- Bookies (The Man Who Broke the World Leading Bookmakers)} and start
my learning from an outsider which don't know any statistical tools for
modelling until successfully completed the research in year 2012. Kindly
refer to \href{https://englianhu.wordpress.com/}{My personal WordPress
blog} for more experience and bloopers. \bigbreak

Now I would like to share some bloopers during process this thesis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Remarks} : Due to the mathematical LaTeX formula and greek
  letters unable use in
  \href{https://github.com/rstudio/rticles}{\textbf{rticles} package}.
  Here I forced to use some image for substitution.
\item
  Due to the Microsoft Excel file inside my previous project
  \href{https://www.dropbox.com/home/Research\%20Project\%202}{dataset}
  for \textbf{Odds Modelling and Testing Inefficiency of
  Sports-Bookmakers} \emph{2008-2010 by ®yo Eng Lian Hu} is very huge in
  xlsx format and set with a struture frame. Therefore I just omit to
  apply \texttt{openxlsx} to read the data for further process.
\item
  I tried to convert the xlxs files to pdf format and attached as
  appendices but system keep endless processing there but no outcome.
  Secondly, huge dataset make it trouble to read into ®Studio and
  summarise and plotting some d3 graphs.
\item
  The embed figures always not align in order, some figures will always
  align to other topic after knit.
